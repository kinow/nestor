## Test Specification

Test specification involves managing test suites and test cases. A project can contain
several test suites. A test suite, by its turn, can contain other test suites, or test cases.
A test case is a leaf, and has no children nodes.

There are two types of test cases, manual and automated test cases. Its icon varies in the
navigation tree.
